## How to use

To use this library, you need install a “superkey” credential file in
your `~/.config/vertexauth/default/superkey.json`.

Then, you can do the following to get access to a `claudette.Client`,
which is authenticated to use Anthropic’s Sonnet 3.5 v2 model, hosted on
Vertex AI and paid for by Google Cloud budget:

``` python
from vertexauth.core import get_claudette_client
cl = get_claudette_client()
```

``` python
cl("Hi, Claude!")
```

What is a superkey? It is merely a Google Cloud Service Account Key
File, encoded in JSON, with a `region` key/value pair added.

Please consult the notebook `00_core.ipynb` for a working example of
creating a service account, creating a service account key, downloading
the key file, and saving a superkey file into the default location.
